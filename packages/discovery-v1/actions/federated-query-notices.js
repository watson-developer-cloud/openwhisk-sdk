/**
 * Query multiple collection system notices.
 *
 * Queries for notices (errors or warnings) that might have been generated by the system. Notices are generated when ingesting documents and performing relevance training. See the [Discovery service documentation](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/discovery/using.html) for more details on the query language.
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - The password used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_access_token] - An IAM access token fully managed by the application. Responsibility falls on the application to refresh the token, either before it expires or reactively upon receiving a 401 from the service, as any requests made with an expired token will fail.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_apikey] - An API key that can be used to request IAM tokens. If this API key is provided, the SDK will manage the token and handle the refreshing.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_url] - An optional URL for the IAM service API. Defaults to 'https://iam.ng.bluemix.net/identity/token'.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom HTTP request headers
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.version - Release date of the API version in YYYY-MM-DD format.
 * @param {string} params.environment_id - The ID of the environment.
 * @param {string[]} params.collection_ids - A comma-separated list of collection IDs to be queried against.
 * @param {string} [params.filter] - A cacheable query that limits the documents returned to exclude any documents that don't mention the query content. Filter searches are better for metadata type searches and when you are trying to get a sense of concepts in the data set.
 * @param {string} [params.query] - A query search returns all documents in your data set with full enrichments and full text, but with the most relevant documents listed first. Use a query search when you want to find the most relevant search results. You cannot use `natural_language_query` and `query` at the same time.
 * @param {string} [params.natural_language_query] - A natural language query that returns relevant documents by utilizing training data and natural language understanding. You cannot use `natural_language_query` and `query` at the same time.
 * @param {string} [params.aggregation] - An aggregation search uses combinations of filters and query search to return an exact answer. Aggregations are useful for building applications, because you can use them to build lists, tables, and time series. For a full list of possible aggregrations, see the Query reference.
 * @param {number} [params.count] - Number of documents to return.
 * @param {string[]} [params.return_fields] - A comma separated list of the portion of the document hierarchy to return.
 * @param {number} [params.offset] - The number of query results to skip at the beginning. For example, if the total number of results that are returned is 10, and the offset is 8, it returns the last two results.
 * @param {string[]} [params.sort] - A comma separated list of fields in the document to sort on. You can optionally specify a sort direction by prefixing the field with `-` for descending or `+` for ascending. Ascending is the default sort direction if no prefix is specified.
 * @param {boolean} [params.highlight] - When true a highlight field is returned for each result which contains the fields that match the query with `<em></em>` tags around the matching query terms. Defaults to false.
 * @param {string} [params.deduplicate_field] - When specified, duplicate results based on the field specified are removed from the returned results. Duplicate comparison is limited to the current query only, `offset` is not considered. This parameter is currently Beta functionality.
 * @param {boolean} [params.similar] - When `true`, results are returned based on their similarity to the document IDs specified in the `similar.document_ids` parameter. The default is `false`.
 * @param {string[]} [params.similar_document_ids] - A comma-separated list of document IDs that will be used to find similar documents.   **Note:** If the `natural_language_query` parameter is also specified, it will be used to expand the scope of the document similarity search to include the natural language query. Other query parameters, such as `filter` and `query` are subsequently applied and reduce the query scope.
 * @param {string[]} [params.similar_fields] - A comma-separated list of field names that will be used as a basis for comparison to identify similar documents. If not specified, the entire document is used for comparison.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
