/**
 * Search the query and event log.
 *
 * Searches the query and event log to find query sessions that match the specified criteria. Searching the **logs**
 * endpoint uses the standard Discovery query syntax for the parameters that are supported.
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - The password used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_access_token] - An IAM access token fully managed by the application. Responsibility falls on the application to refresh the token, either before it expires or reactively upon receiving a 401 from the service, as any requests made with an expired token will fail.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_apikey] - An API key that can be used to request IAM tokens. If this API key is provided, the SDK will manage the token and handle the refreshing.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_url] - An optional URL for the IAM service API. Defaults to 'https://iam.bluemix.net/identity/token'.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom HTTP request headers
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.version - Release date of the API version in YYYY-MM-DD format.
 * @param {string} [params.filter] - A cacheable query that excludes documents that don't mention the query content.
 * Filter searches are better for metadata-type searches and for assessing the concepts in the data set.
 * @param {string} [params.query] - A query search returns all documents in your data set with full enrichments and full
 * text, but with the most relevant documents listed first. Use a query search when you want to find the most relevant
 * search results. You cannot use **natural_language_query** and **query** at the same time.
 * @param {number} [params.count] - Number of results to return.
 * @param {number} [params.offset] - The number of query results to skip at the beginning. For example, if the total
 * number of results that are returned is 10 and the offset is 8, it returns the last two results.
 * @param {string[]} [params.sort] - A comma-separated list of fields in the document to sort on. You can optionally
 * specify a sort direction by prefixing the field with `-` for descending or `+` for ascending. Ascending is the
 * default sort direction if no prefix is specified.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
