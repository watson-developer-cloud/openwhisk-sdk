/**
 * Check a job.
 *
 * Returns information about the specified job. The response always includes the status of the job and its creation and
 * update times. If the status is `completed`, the response includes the results of the recognition request. You must
 * submit the request with the service credentials of the user who created the job.
 *
 * You can use the method to retrieve the results of any job, regardless of whether it was submitted with a callback URL
 * and the `recognitions.completed_with_results` event, and you can retrieve the results multiple times for as long as
 * they remain available. Use the **Check jobs** method to request information about the most recent jobs associated
 * with the caller.
 *
 * **See also:** [Checking the status and retrieving the results of a
 * job](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/async.html#job).
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - The password used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_access_token] - An IAM access token fully managed by the application. Responsibility falls on the application to refresh the token, either before it expires or reactively upon receiving a 401 from the service, as any requests made with an expired token will fail.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_apikey] - An API key that can be used to request IAM tokens. If this API key is provided, the SDK will manage the token and handle the refreshing.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_url] - An optional URL for the IAM service API. Defaults to 'https://iam.bluemix.net/identity/token'.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom HTTP request headers
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.id - The identifier of the asynchronous job that is to be used for the request.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
