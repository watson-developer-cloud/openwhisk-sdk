/**
 * Check jobs.
 *
 * Returns the ID and status of the latest 100 outstanding jobs associated with the service credentials with which it is
 * called. The method also returns the creation and update times of each job, and, if a job was created with a callback
 * URL and a user token, the user token for the job. To obtain the results for a job whose status is `completed` or not
 * one of the latest 100 outstanding jobs, use the **Check a job** method. A job and its results remain available until
 * you delete them with the **Delete a job** method or until the job's time to live expires, whichever comes first.
 *
 * **See also:** [Checking the status of the latest
 * jobs](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/async.html#jobs).
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - The password used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_access_token] - An IAM access token fully managed by the application. Responsibility falls on the application to refresh the token, either before it expires or reactively upon receiving a 401 from the service, as any requests made with an expired token will fail.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_apikey] - An API key that can be used to request IAM tokens. If this API key is provided, the SDK will manage the token and handle the refreshing.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_url] - An optional URL for the IAM service API. Defaults to 'https://iam.bluemix.net/identity/token'.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom HTTP request headers
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
