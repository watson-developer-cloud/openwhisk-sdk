/**
 * Create a job.
 *
 * Creates a job for a new asynchronous recognition request. The job is owned by the user whose service credentials are used to create it. How you learn the status and results of a job depends on the parameters you include with the job creation request: * By callback notification: Include the `callback_url` parameter to specify a URL to which the service is to send callback notifications when the status of the job changes. Optionally, you can also include the `events` and `user_token` parameters to subscribe to specific events and to specify a string that is to be included with each notification for the job. * By polling the service: Omit the `callback_url`, `events`, and `user_token` parameters. You must then use the **Check jobs** or **Check a job** methods to check the status of the job, using the latter to retrieve the results when the job is complete.  The two approaches are not mutually exclusive. You can poll the service for job status or obtain results from the service manually even if you include a callback URL. In both cases, you can include the `results_ttl` parameter to specify how long the results are to remain available after the job is complete. For detailed usage information about the two approaches, including callback notifications, see [Creating a job](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/async.html#create). Using the HTTPS **Check a job** method to retrieve results is more secure than receiving them via callback notification over HTTP because it provides confidentiality in addition to authentication and data integrity.   The method supports the same basic parameters as other HTTP and WebSocket recognition requests. The service imposes a data size limit of 100 MB. It automatically detects the endianness of the incoming audio and, for audio that includes multiple channels, downmixes the audio to one-channel mono during transcoding. (For the `audio/l16` format, you can specify the endianness.)   ### Audio formats (content types)   Use the `Content-Type` parameter to specify the audio format (MIME type) of the audio: * `audio/basic` (Use only with narrowband models.) * `audio/flac` * `audio/l16` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the number of channels (`channels`) and endianness (`endianness`) of the audio.) * `audio/mp3` * `audio/mpeg` * `audio/mulaw` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.) * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.) * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus` * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis` * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.) * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.) * `audio/webm;codecs=opus` * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`   For information about the supported audio formats, including specifying the sampling rate, channels, and endianness for the indicated formats, see [Audio formats](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/audio-formats.html).
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - The password used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_access_token] - An IAM access token fully managed by the application. Responsibility falls on the application to refresh the token, either before it expires or reactively upon receiving a 401 from the service, as any requests made with an expired token will fail.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_apikey] - An API key that can be used to request IAM tokens. If this API key is provided, the SDK will manage the token and handle the refreshing.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_url] - An optional URL for the IAM service API. Defaults to 'https://iam.bluemix.net/identity/token'.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom HTTP request headers
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {ReadableStream|FileObject|Buffer} params.audio - The audio to transcribe in the format specified by the `Content-Type` header.
 * @param {string} params.content_type - The type of the input: audio/basic, audio/flac, audio/l16, audio/mp3, audio/mpeg, audio/mulaw, audio/ogg, audio/ogg;codecs=opus, audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis, audio/wav, audio/webm, audio/webm;codecs=opus, or audio/webm;codecs=vorbis.
 * @param {string} [params.model] - The identifier of the model that is to be used for the recognition request or, for the **Create a session** method, with the new session.
 * @param {string} [params.callback_url] - A URL to which callback notifications are to be sent. The URL must already be successfully white-listed by using the **Register a callback** method. Omit the parameter to poll the service for job completion and results. You can include the same callback URL with any number of job creation requests. Use the `user_token` parameter to specify a unique user-specified string with each job to differentiate the callback notifications for the jobs.
 * @param {string} [params.events] - If the job includes a callback URL, a comma-separated list of notification events to which to subscribe. Valid events are: `recognitions.started` generates a callback notification when the service begins to process the job. `recognitions.completed` generates a callback notification when the job is complete; you must use the **Check a job** method to retrieve the results before they time out or are deleted. `recognitions.completed_with_results` generates a callback notification when the job is complete; the notification includes the results of the request. `recognitions.failed` generates a callback notification if the service experiences an error while processing the job. Omit the parameter to subscribe to the default events: `recognitions.started`, `recognitions.completed`, and `recognitions.failed`. The `recognitions.completed` and `recognitions.completed_with_results` events are incompatible; you can specify only of the two events. If the job does not include a callback URL, omit the parameter.
 * @param {string} [params.user_token] - If the job includes a callback URL, a user-specified string that the service is to include with each callback notification for the job; the token allows the user to maintain an internal mapping between jobs and notification events. If the job does not include a callback URL, omit the parameter.
 * @param {number} [params.results_ttl] - The number of minutes for which the results are to be available after the job has finished. If not delivered via a callback, the results must be retrieved within this time. Omit the parameter to use a time to live of one week. The parameter is valid with or without a callback URL.
 * @param {string} [params.customization_id] - The customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model that is to be used with the recognition request or, for the **Create a session** method, with the new session. The base model of the specified custom language model must match the model specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model. By default, no custom language model is used.
 * @param {string} [params.acoustic_customization_id] - The customization ID (GUID) of a custom acoustic model that is to be used with the recognition request or, for the **Create a session** method, with the new session. The base model of the specified custom acoustic model must match the model specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model. By default, no custom acoustic model is used.
 * @param {string} [params.base_model_version] - The version of the specified base model that is to be used with recognition request or, for the **Create a session** method, with the new session. Multiple versions of a base model can exist when a model is updated for internal improvements. The parameter is intended primarily for use with custom models that have been upgraded for a new base model. The default value depends on whether the parameter is used with or without a custom model. For more information, see [Base model version](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#version).
 * @param {number} [params.customization_weight] - If you specify the customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model with the recognition request or, for sessions, with the **Create a session** method, the customization weight tells the service how much weight to give to words from the custom language model compared to those from the base model for the current request.   Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Unless a different customization weight was specified for the custom model when it was trained, the default value is 0.3. A customization weight that you specify overrides a weight that was specified when the custom model was trained.   The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if your audio makes frequent use of OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy of phrases from the custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain phrases.
 * @param {number} [params.inactivity_timeout] - The time in seconds after which, if only silence (no speech) is detected in submitted audio, the connection is closed with a 400 error. Useful for stopping audio submission from a live microphone when a user simply walks away. Use `-1` for infinity.
 * @param {string[]} [params.keywords] - An array of keyword strings to spot in the audio. Each keyword string can include one or more tokens. Keywords are spotted only in the final hypothesis, not in interim results. If you specify any keywords, you must also specify a keywords threshold. You can spot a maximum of 1000 keywords. Omit the parameter or specify an empty array if you do not need to spot keywords.
 * @param {number} [params.keywords_threshold] - A confidence value that is the lower bound for spotting a keyword. A word is considered to match a keyword if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0 and 1 inclusive. No keyword spotting is performed if you omit the parameter. If you specify a threshold, you must also specify one or more keywords.
 * @param {number} [params.max_alternatives] - The maximum number of alternative transcripts to be returned. By default, a single transcription is returned.
 * @param {number} [params.word_alternatives_threshold] - A confidence value that is the lower bound for identifying a hypothesis as a possible word alternative (also known as "Confusion Networks"). An alternative word is considered if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0 and 1 inclusive. No alternative words are computed if you omit the parameter.
 * @param {boolean} [params.word_confidence] - If `true`, a confidence measure in the range of 0 to 1 is returned for each word. By default, no word confidence measures are returned.
 * @param {boolean} [params.timestamps] - If `true`, time alignment is returned for each word. By default, no timestamps are returned.
 * @param {boolean} [params.profanity_filter] - If `true` (the default), filters profanity from all output except for keyword results by replacing inappropriate words with a series of asterisks. Set the parameter to `false` to return results with no censoring. Applies to US English transcription only.
 * @param {boolean} [params.smart_formatting] - If `true`, converts dates, times, series of digits and numbers, phone numbers, currency values, and internet addresses into more readable, conventional representations in the final transcript of a recognition request. For US English, also converts certain keyword strings to punctuation symbols. By default, no smart formatting is performed. Applies to US English and Spanish transcription only.
 * @param {boolean} [params.speaker_labels] - If `true`, the response includes labels that identify which words were spoken by which participants in a multi-person exchange. By default, no speaker labels are returned. Setting `speaker_labels` to `true` forces the `timestamps` parameter to be `true`, regardless of whether you specify `false` for the parameter.   To determine whether a language model supports speaker labels, use the **Get models** method and check that the attribute `speaker_labels` is set to `true`. You can also refer to [Speaker labels](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#speaker_labels).
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
