/**
 * Create a custom language model.
 *
 * Creates a new custom language model for a specified base model. The custom language model can be used only with the base model for which it is created. The model is owned by the instance of the service whose credentials are used to create it.
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - The password used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_access_token] - An IAM access token fully managed by the application. Responsibility falls on the application to refresh the token, either before it expires or reactively upon receiving a 401 from the service, as any requests made with an expired token will fail.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_apikey] - An API key that can be used to request IAM tokens. If this API key is provided, the SDK will manage the token and handle the refreshing.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_url] - An optional URL for the IAM service API. Defaults to 'https://iam.bluemix.net/identity/token'.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom HTTP request headers
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.name - A user-defined name for the new custom language model. Use a name that is unique among all custom language models that you own. Use a localized name that matches the language of the custom model. Use a name that describes the domain of the custom model, such as `Medical custom model` or `Legal custom model`.
 * @param {string} params.base_model_name - The name of the base language model that is to be customized by the new custom language model. The new custom model can be used only with the base model that it customizes. To determine whether a base model supports language model customization, request information about the base model and check that the attribute `custom_language_model` is set to `true`, or refer to [Language support for customization](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/custom.html#languageSupport).
 * @param {string} [params.dialect] - The dialect of the specified language that is to be used with the custom language model. The parameter is meaningful only for Spanish models, for which the service creates a custom language model that is suited for speech in one of the following dialects: * `es-ES` for Castilian Spanish (the default) * `es-LA` for Latin American Spanish * `es-US` for North American (Mexican) Spanish   A specified dialect must be valid for the base model. By default, the dialect matches the language of the base model; for example, `en-US` for either of the US English language models.
 * @param {string} [params.description] - A description of the new custom language model. Use a localized description that matches the language of the custom model.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
