/**
 * Delete labeled data.
 *
 * Deletes all data that is associated with a specified customer ID. The method deletes all data for the customer ID,
 * regardless of the method by which the information was added. The method has no effect if no data is associated with
 * the customer ID. You must issue the request with credentials for the same instance of the service that was used to
 * associate the customer ID with the data.
 *
 * You associate a customer ID with data by passing the `X-Watson-Metadata` header with a request that passes the data.
 *
 * **See also:** [Information
 * security](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/information-security.html).
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - The password used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_access_token] - An IAM access token fully managed by the application. Responsibility falls on the application to refresh the token, either before it expires or reactively upon receiving a 401 from the service, as any requests made with an expired token will fail.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_apikey] - An API key that can be used to request IAM tokens. If this API key is provided, the SDK will manage the token and handle the refreshing.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_url] - An optional URL for the IAM service API. Defaults to 'https://iam.bluemix.net/identity/token'.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom HTTP request headers
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.customer_id - The customer ID for which all data is to be deleted.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
