/**
 * List custom language models.
 *
 * Lists information about all custom language models that are owned by an instance of the service. Use the `language`
 * parameter to see all custom language models for the specified language. Omit the parameter to see all custom language
 * models for all languages. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to list
 * information about it.
 *
 * **See also:** [Listing custom language
 * models](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/language-models.html#listModels).
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - The password used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_access_token] - An IAM access token fully managed by the application. Responsibility falls on the application to refresh the token, either before it expires or reactively upon receiving a 401 from the service, as any requests made with an expired token will fail.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_apikey] - An API key that can be used to request IAM tokens. If this API key is provided, the SDK will manage the token and handle the refreshing.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_url] - An optional URL for the IAM service API. Defaults to 'https://iam.bluemix.net/identity/token'.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom HTTP request headers
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} [params.language] - The identifier of the language for which custom language or custom acoustic
 * models are to be returned (for example, `en-US`). Omit the parameter to see all custom language or custom acoustic
 * models owned by the requesting service credentials.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
