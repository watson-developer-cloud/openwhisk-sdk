/**
 * Add custom words.
 *
 * Adds one or more words and their translations to the specified custom voice model. Adding a new translation for a
 * word that already exists in a custom model overwrites the word's existing translation. A custom model can contain no
 * more than 20,000 entries. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to add words to
 * it.
 *
 * You can define sounds-like or phonetic translations for words. A sounds-like translation consists of one or more
 * words that, when combined, sound like the word. Phonetic translations are based on the SSML phoneme format for
 * representing a word. You can specify them in standard International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) representation
 *
 *   <code>&lt;phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"t&#601;m&#712;&#593;to\"&gt;&lt;/phoneme&gt;</code>
 *
 *   or in the proprietary IBM Symbolic Phonetic Representation (SPR)
 *
 *   <code>&lt;phoneme alphabet=\"ibm\" ph=\"1gAstroEntxrYFXs\"&gt;&lt;/phoneme&gt;</code>
 *
 * **Note:** This method is currently a beta release.

 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - The password used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_access_token] - An IAM access token fully managed by the application. Responsibility falls on the application to refresh the token, either before it expires or reactively upon receiving a 401 from the service, as any requests made with an expired token will fail.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_apikey] - An API key that can be used to request IAM tokens. If this API key is provided, the SDK will manage the token and handle the refreshing.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_url] - An optional URL for the IAM service API. Defaults to 'https://iam.bluemix.net/identity/token'.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom HTTP request headers
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.customization_id - The customization ID (GUID) of the custom voice model. You must make the
 * request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model.
 * @param {Word[]} params.words - The **Add custom words** method accepts an array of `Word` objects. Each object
 * provides a word that is to be added or updated for the custom voice model and the word's translation.
 *
 * The **List custom words** method returns an array of `Word` objects. Each object shows a word and its translation
 * from the custom voice model. The words are listed in alphabetical order, with uppercase letters listed before
 * lowercase letters. The array is empty if the custom model contains no words.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
