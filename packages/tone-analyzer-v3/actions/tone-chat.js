/**
 * Analyze customer engagement tone.
 *
 * Use the customer engagement endpoint to analyze the tone of customer service and customer support conversations. For
 * each utterance of a conversation, the method reports the most prevalent subset of the following seven tones: sad,
 * frustrated, satisfied, excited, polite, impolite, and sympathetic.
 *
 * If you submit more than 50 utterances, the service returns a warning for the overall content and analyzes only the
 * first 50 utterances. If you submit a single utterance that contains more than 500 characters, the service returns an
 * error for that utterance and does not analyze the utterance. The request fails if all utterances have more than 500
 * characters. Per the JSON specification, the default character encoding for JSON content is effectively always UTF-8.
 *
 * **See also:** [Using the customer-engagement
 * endpoint](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/tone-analyzer/using-tone-chat.html#using-the-customer-engagement-endpoint).
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - The password used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_access_token] - An IAM access token fully managed by the application. Responsibility falls on the application to refresh the token, either before it expires or reactively upon receiving a 401 from the service, as any requests made with an expired token will fail.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_apikey] - An API key that can be used to request IAM tokens. If this API key is provided, the SDK will manage the token and handle the refreshing.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_url] - An optional URL for the IAM service API. Defaults to 'https://iam.bluemix.net/identity/token'.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom HTTP request headers
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.version - Release date of the API version in YYYY-MM-DD format.
 * @param {Utterance[]} params.utterances - An array of `Utterance` objects that provides the input content that the
 * service is to analyze.
 * @param {string} [params.content_language] - The language of the input text for the request: English or French.
 * Regional variants are treated as their parent language; for example, `en-US` is interpreted as `en`. The input
 * content must match the specified language. Do not submit content that contains both languages. You can use different
 * languages for **Content-Language** and **Accept-Language**.
 * * **`2017-09-21`:** Accepts `en` or `fr`.
 * * **`2016-05-19`:** Accepts only `en`.
 * @param {string} [params.accept_language] - The desired language of the response. For two-character arguments,
 * regional variants are treated as their parent language; for example, `en-US` is interpreted as `en`. You can use
 * different languages for **Content-Language** and **Accept-Language**.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
