/**
 * Analyze general tone.
 *
 * Use the general purpose endpoint to analyze the tone of your input content. The service analyzes the content for
 * emotional and language tones. The method always analyzes the tone of the full document; by default, it also analyzes
 * the tone of each individual sentence of the content.
 *
 * You can submit no more than 128 KB of total input content and no more than 1000 individual sentences in JSON, plain
 * text, or HTML format. The service analyzes the first 1000 sentences for document-level analysis and only the first
 * 100 sentences for sentence-level analysis.
 *
 * Per the JSON specification, the default character encoding for JSON content is effectively always UTF-8; per the HTTP
 * specification, the default encoding for plain text and HTML is ISO-8859-1 (effectively, the ASCII character set).
 * When specifying a content type of plain text or HTML, include the `charset` parameter to indicate the character
 * encoding of the input text; for example: `Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8`. For `text/html`, the service
 * removes HTML tags and analyzes only the textual content.
 *
 * **See also:** [Using the general-purpose
 * endpoint](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/tone-analyzer/using-tone.html#using-the-general-purpose-endpoint).
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - The password used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_access_token] - An IAM access token fully managed by the application. Responsibility falls on the application to refresh the token, either before it expires or reactively upon receiving a 401 from the service, as any requests made with an expired token will fail.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_apikey] - An API key that can be used to request IAM tokens. If this API key is provided, the SDK will manage the token and handle the refreshing.
 * @param {string} [params.iam_url] - An optional URL for the IAM service API. Defaults to 'https://iam.bluemix.net/identity/token'.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers] - Custom HTTP request headers
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.version - Release date of the API version in YYYY-MM-DD format.
 * @param {ToneInput} params.tone_input - JSON, plain text, or HTML input that contains the content to be analyzed. For
 * JSON input, provide an object of type `ToneInput`.
 * @param {string} params.content_type - The type of the input. A character encoding can be specified by including a
 * `charset` parameter. For example, 'text/plain;charset=utf-8'.
 * @param {boolean} [params.sentences] - Indicates whether the service is to return an analysis of each individual
 * sentence in addition to its analysis of the full document. If `true` (the default), the service returns results for
 * each sentence.
 * @param {string[]} [params.tones] - **`2017-09-21`:** Deprecated. The service continues to accept the parameter for
 * backward-compatibility, but the parameter no longer affects the response.
 *
 * **`2016-05-19`:** A comma-separated list of tones for which the service is to return its analysis of the input; the
 * indicated tones apply both to the full document and to individual sentences of the document. You can specify one or
 * more of the valid values. Omit the parameter to request results for all three tones.
 * @param {string} [params.content_language] - The language of the input text for the request: English or French.
 * Regional variants are treated as their parent language; for example, `en-US` is interpreted as `en`. The input
 * content must match the specified language. Do not submit content that contains both languages. You can use different
 * languages for **Content-Language** and **Accept-Language**.
 * * **`2017-09-21`:** Accepts `en` or `fr`.
 * * **`2016-05-19`:** Accepts only `en`.
 * @param {string} [params.accept_language] - The desired language of the response. For two-character arguments,
 * regional variants are treated as their parent language; for example, `en-US` is interpreted as `en`. You can use
 * different languages for **Content-Language** and **Accept-Language**.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
